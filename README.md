# RockPaperScissors

My first project combining Javascript programming and displaying objects using DOM manipulation. Also, includes my first exposure to changes to the color and layout with CSS.

## Reflection

This was first project putting together many different parts of what I learned so far. Programming with Javascript was fun as it included the problem solving piece that I enjoy! Learning about the DOM was very interesting and seeing the final product was so satisfying!
